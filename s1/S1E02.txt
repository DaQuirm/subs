~The Sting of the Scorpion~
subtitles by Nash

You know, Parker, you are unpredictable. This is not the direction I want us to go.

But I thought you lived this way.

No! I mean direction in life, Parker. I don’t want us to start dating.

What’s wrong with us dating? We study together all the time!

That’s different. That’s because... I need your help in science. You’re the only man I know who can remember everything about protons, neutrons, alpha-rays, gamma-rays...

I guess I simply glow on the subject of radiation. I don’t know why, it must be in my blood.

Precisely. You’re a natural student. But dinner with you would be a date. And date ~?#1~. Please don’t be offended, Parker.

But Felicia, why can’t you think of me as a boyfriend?

Spider sense! Danger!

I have enough men asking me out. But a good tutor? That’s  ~?#2~. Parker? Peter? He walked away from me. Who does he think he is?

After being rejected all evening by Felicia, it sure bolsters your old spirits to finally get into a little action. Now, who is that little creep? Some mugger after my money? Heck, if I could find any on me, I’d split it with him! Well it shouldn’t be to hard to keep him in sight... Whoa!

*Explosion*

II should’ve stuck with Felicia! Web fluid, I love you. If those explosions were accidental, then I’m the Human Torch! Uh-huh, just as I thought. They don’t look like they are ?in it? for night school.

Oooaaa!

It’s not nice to rob jewellery stores in ?Mr.? Spider-Man’s neighborhood. Can you say “I’m going to jail”?

Where the hell is Joey?

Who cares? Let’s get out of here!

Well, if it isn’t a meeting of The Diamond Lovers of America!

It’s Spider-Man!

What? Spider-Man? Where? Where? I just get so flustered when I meet a celebrity. I just don’t know what to say!

How about you just say goodbye?

I’m way ahead of you.

Stay still, will you?

Actually, no.

Yaaah!

Get him!

It’s three against one!

As far as I’m concerned, that means you’re outnumbered!

Good thing I remembered to set this up ahead of time.

I hate to use so much expensive webbing on yo-yoes like them. Too bad that ?I gotta crawl all the way?. ?Wonder? who he was.

Peter, these photos are terrific. In all my years as editor I’ve never known a photographer as resourceful as you.

Well, thanks, Mr. Robertson.

I don’t know how do you get these, uh...

Me neither. You’re always in just the right place at just the right time. Tell me, Parker, what’s your secret?

Er... A good ~?#3~ lens and a lot of walk I guess...

Is that so? So there isn’t something else that you wanna tell us?

Well, I would like to get my paycheck today. If you don’t mind.

Parker, you really tick me off! I’ll find out how a young squirt like you gets those photos. Sooner or later.

Better make it later. Bye!

He’s got no use for me, he hates Spider-Man. I bet he can’t even stand himself! Although <i>that</i> would make sense.

Well what do you know? The little creep!

Sorry, he almost spotted me last night. I just ain’t had any ~?#4~

Gargan, you are worthless.

Oh, gee, mister Jameson don’t call me names! People have been making fun of me all my life!

Yeah, I can see why. Parker must know Spider-Man. That has to be how he gets those photos. How hard can it be to follow him to Spider-Man’s hideout?

So that’s what old fuzzhead is up to.

Is this a private party or can any wall?(er)? crawler join?

Hey, what are you think you are... mmph

I’ve got a message for your pal Parker. ~?#5~ I catch him following me again, snapping his little pictures, I’m doing this to him! And that’s if I’m in a good mood! As for you, pruneface, get off my case, you hear?

I’m warning you, Jameson. Get off my case or else...

Are you listening, Jameson?

Yeah, I hear you.

Wonderful. Till next time, kiddies.

~?#6~ old flat top off the trail.

It won’t happen again.

That’s Spider-Freak... Making me look ridiculous. People are always trying to make me look ridiculous.

You are ridiculous, Gargan. But how would you like to get back at him and make a real name for yourself?

Me? Get back at Spider-Man? I’ll kill for a chance.

And you are on.

I have one trick up my sleeve that will get that wall-crawling wimp out of my hair forever. Get me the Genetics Lab in Empire State University. I wanna talk to professor Stillwell.

I’ve made all the preparations.

So this is the neogenic recombinator!

Yes, and this is the battlesuit. Beautiful, isn’t it?

It oughta be, considering what I paid for it. Aight, let’s get going!

Doc, what are doing to me? I feel strange.

Easy. It’s a radiation.

Radiation? Ain’t that stuff dangerous?

Not for someone with your limited intelligence.

Gargan, this is what you said you wanted. Don’t chicken out on me now.

I ain’t no chicken, Mr. Jameson. I just wanna know what’s going on. Stop!

Stillwell, what’s wrong with him?

He’ll be OK. Neogenic recombinator is restructuring Gargan’s DNA to match the genetic code of a scorpion. I chose to use a scorpion because it’s a natural predator of the spider. See? It’s working.

Spider-Man will at last meet his match.

Urrrghaaa!

This is J-3-Bravo, I’ve got a spider sighting. Heading due south.

I copy that, J-3-Bravo. We’ve finally found him, Mr. Jameson.

Oh, man. I’ve got three science papers due Friday. I have to study all night for a big exam and I’m still ~?#7~ with Felicia.

Get ready, Scorpion.

I hear ya.

~?#8~web-swing to help me relax. I’d be wound up tired ~?#9~... Now what?

Who the heck are you?!

A real hero, you freak.

This is a joke, right? Whoa! This is not a joke! If you wanna join the Fantastic Four, you’re in the wrong place!

Highly corrosive acid! How do I get the feeling he’s not into male bonding? Where’d he go?

Look! I’m stronger and faster than you! Hahahah! >:D

I gotta get this creep away from these busy streets before some innocent bystander gets hurt. Hey, pal, let’s go talk this over someplace where it’s <i>just</i> you and me!

That’s it, Gargan. Do him off! Get him!

Who’s doing this fight, me or you?

Who are you talking to?

Wouldn’t you like to know?

You are dead meat, little man!

Go! Go! Get him!

No! You’re doing it all wrong!

Did you expect your crummy webs to stop me?

The thought had crossed my mind.

Yes! Good move! Excellent!

How about that? I beat Spider-Man! Taken out by the one and only Scorpion!

Quit stalling, Gargan, unmask him!

What’s happening to me? No! No!

What are you waiting for? Unmask him now!

I’ve become a freak. A monster!

Lower me down. I’ll unmask him myself.

You tricked me! You’ve never said this would happen.

What are you doing?

What do you think? Getting as much distance from that lunatic as possible!

No! Go down! Down!

I am. When I get back to base. Fire me if you want to but I have a family to think about.

Jonah! Check the main feed!

Oh, no. What have I done?

You? What do you mean?

Robbie, I helped to create that thing!

You what? Why would you do such a thing?

I did it for Julia, my wife. Years ago a crime boss warned me to back off a story but I refused. One night a man came after me. A man in a mask. He aimed at me but he hit her. Now I’ve sworn to keep this city safe from people who hide behind masks and think that they’re above the law.

That’s exactly what your creation is doing! You’ve got to stop him!

You’re right, Robbie. I made a horrible mistake.

Every bone in my body is killing me. I’d love to rest up, but I’ve gotta find the green goon before he levels all of Manhattan.

Stillwell, do something! Gargan’s going berserk!

I know! The genetic realignment is making him mentally unstable. Professor Connors was right. Neogenics is too experimental, too dangerous to use on a human being.

Stillwell, fix me! Make me like I was!

I-I can’t, the process is regenerating exponentially like a nuclear chain reaction. It’s too far out of control!

Not again, oooorgh! You lying... You! This is your fault. You want me to stay this way so I can destroy Spider-Man!

Stop, Gargan! What are you doing?!

I’m gonna let you live just long enough to find out.

Can we get a shot at him? Negative, he’s got a hostage. Stay back.

No, really Aunt May, everything is OK. I just won’t be home for lunch.

But, Peter, I’ve invited Anna Watson’s niece Mary Jane.

Oh, right, I’m sorry, I forgot. I can’t make it home right now. The traffic, it’s terrible! In fact, it’s really crawling. Look, Aunt May, I really gotta go.

Alright, dear. But don’t stay out too late. You sound like you are catching a bug.

I certainly hope so.

Whaaat?

Nothing, Aunt May. I’ll be careful. Bye!

Did I just see Jonah Jameson with the Scorpion? Or should I start wearing glasses again?

That’s the Oscorp nuclear reactor. Why are you heading there?

‘Cause radiation made me this way.And I’m gonna use it to change me back into who I was.

I’ll punch a hole inside. And get to radiation. I think it’s in the middle somewhere. Aaaarrgh.

Gargan, you’re insane! You’ll unleash radiation on a whole city!

Not my problem, pal. And quit calling me names.

Green ball in the center pocket!

I’d ask what are you doing here Jameson, but something tells me I don’t wanna know. A nuclear reactor? Why don’t villains ever pick bakeries to invade?

Uh-oh.

What’s that alarm?

The Scorpion just activated the neutron absorbing control ?rides? behind that door. Now they are automatically being removed from the nuclear chamber. They control the rate of the chain reaction inside the reactor. Without them the nuclear fission in the chamber increases. If we don’t get them back in then the heat will make this thing blow and we’ll all turn into walking nightlights!

How can we stop it?

The cancel. The red button. I bet my web shooter that’s the emergency shutdown. Trust me, it’s always the red button.

How do you know about stuff like this?

Hey, who do I look like? A ??tick?

Gotta get to the core.

Hold it, Scorpy.  You don’t realize what are you doing!

Oh yeah? I’m doing this!

What are you up to?

You heard that man. I’ve got to hit that red button or the reactor will melt down and the city will be destroyed by radiation.

Who cares? Long as I get what I’m after.

Look, if we continue to meet like this tongues will begin to wag. What are you made of? Adamantium?

I’m gonna crush you now.

Oh yeah? It just so happens I like to start each day with a warm hug. Who am I kidding? Everything... is going... black.

You gotta be nuts, mister. Why would you risk your puny life to save his?

Because you’re a greater evil. And heaven help me he is the only one who can stop you.

Huh? Did I hear right? J. Jonah Jameson on my side?

He can’t stop me if I squash him first!

Scorpion! You are nothing but a worm. An insect. A silly sap!

I told you before. Don’t call me names.

Now this gives me an idea. So, you don’t like names, huh? Well that’s too bad, frogface ‘Cause to me you are nothing but a ~?#10~ no account, second-rate, sewer-breath ~?#11~ with a brain of a pigeon and a face of an eel!

Stop it!

Jameson! Get down!

Oh, my aching head...

Hey, buster, I’m hurting more than you. I’m suffering from double fission. Get it? Double fission?

I knew I never should’ve left Brooklyn.

Oh, nevermind.

Thanks, JJ for backing me up. I guess things will be different between us now, huh?

No way! This doesn’t change a thing between us. I still won’t rest until you’ve been unmasked. And eliminated.

Fair enough, picklepuss. And I won’t rest until you’ve shaved that stupid moustache! So we’re even!

Oh, and fuzz head. Thanks for saving my life.

Jameson saving me is like Moriarty saving Sherlock Holmes. Life’s sure full of surprises.

Well, Stillwell’s in a hospital, Scorpion’s in jail. Old Jonah’s probably writing a nasty editorial against Spider-Man. Well at least things ought to be quiet for a whi...

Hey!

Parker! I’ve been looking all over for you. You know you really made me angry the other night. Walking away like that. But...

But?

I guess you’re trying to tell me that sometimes I’m a little difficult. I can deal with that. You know, Parker, you are unpredictable. I find it interesting.

No kidding? Does this mean we can have dinner together?

No, maybe lunch. Ciao!

“Maybe lunch”? I think she’s starting to like me. Yep, life’s definitely full of surprises.
