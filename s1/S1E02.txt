You know, Parker, you are unpredictable. This is not the direction I want us to go.


But I thought you lived this way.


No! I mean direction in life, Parker. I don’t want us to start dating.


What’s wrong with us dating? We study together all the time!


That’s different. That’s because... I need your help in science. You’re the only man I know who can remember everything about protons, neutrons, alpha-rays, gamma-rays...


I guess I simply glow on the subject of radiation. I don’t know why, it must be in my blood. 


Precisely. You’re a natural student. But dinner with you would be a date. And date ~?#1~. Please don’t be offended, Parker.


But Felicia, why can’t you think of me as a boyfriend?


Spider sense! Danger!


I have enough men asking me out. But a good tutor? That’s  ~?#2~. Parker? Peter? He walked away from me. Who does he think he is?


After being rejected all evening by Felicia, it sure bolsters your old spirits to finally get into a little action. Now, who is that little creep? Some mugger after my money? Heck, if I could find any on me, I’d split it with him! Well it shouldn’t be to hard to keep him in sight... Whoa! 


*Explosion*


II should’ve stuck with Felicia! Web fluid, I love you. If those explosions were accidental, then I’m the Human Torch! Uh-huh, just as I thought. They don’t look like they are ?in it? for night school.


Oooaaa!


It’s not nice to rob jewellery stores in ?Mr.? Spider-Man’s neighborhood. Can you say “I’m going to jail”?


Where the hell is Joey?


Who cares? Let’s get out of here!


Well, if it isn’t a meeting of The Diamond Lovers of America!


It’s Spider-Man! 


What? Spider-Man? Where? Where? I just get so flustered when I meet a celebrity. I just don’t know what to say!


How about you just say goodbye?


I’m way ahead of you.


Stay still, will you?


Actually, no.


Yaaah!


Get him!


It’s three against one! 


As far as I’m concerned, that means you’re outnumbered!


Good thing I remembered to set this up ahead of time.


I hate to use so much expensive webbing on yo-yoes like them. Too bad that ?I gotta crawl all the way?. ?Wonder? who he was.


Peter, these photos are terrific. In all my years as editor I’ve never known a photographer as resourceful as you.


Well, thanks, Mr. Robertson.


I don’t know how do you get these, uh...


Me neither. You’re always in just the right place at just the right time. Tell me, Parker, what’s your secret?


Er... A good ~?#3~ lens and a lot of walk I guess...


Is that so? So there isn’t something else that you wanna tell us?
Well, I would like to get my paycheck today. If you don’t mind.


Parker, you really tick me off! I’ll find out how a young squirt like you gets those photos. Sooner or later.


Better make it later. Bye!
