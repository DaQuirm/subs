New York city


If only everything down there was really as peaceful as it looks from up here

Yeah, hold it right there


Yeah, like I was saying


You gonna love working down here?


It's cool in the summer and warm in the winter


And no office politics


Oh, sounds better than my last job


I was in the television business


-TV? Really?


Hey, my old TV gets this double image if you know what I mean


Hey, maybe you could...


No, I was a TV executive


Oh, you're better off down here


Holy!..
ghhrhrhrrkkk


Oh, it's got me!


Oh! Help!


Aaaaaaaaaa!


Those eyes! They're after me!


What's this?


Another ?satisfied? graduate of New York City Cab Driving Academy?


hit the break


Turn! Turn!


What was <i>that</i> all about


eyes, red eyes after me?


Uh-huh. And did they belong to the little pink elephants?


No, ?mister? it was real, it was real, I swear!


Yeah, alright, fine!


Just don't let the cops blame this one on me, okay?


The red eyes! The red eyes!


Sure, pal. Whatever you say.


New York City. Never a dull moment


Well, guess it all goes with the job


Peter, I have a new job for you


You've always gotten good shots of spiderman, right?


Let's see what you can do with the Lizard


The who?


The Lizard, Parker


If you'd ever get here on time maybe you'd know what was going on


There've been reports


of a giant lizard down in the subways


In this town who'd notice?


I'd notice


This one's serious, Parker


*???*


I don't know about that, Brock


You're just the reporter, I'd send on a wild goose chase


It's not a wild goose chase ****


Look, subway repairman, missing. His friend says the Lizard got him


Boss, I got those names of the scientists who work with reptiles


Good! Then you can interview 'em for background?


Right. Closest one's at Empire State, name's Connors


<i>Doctor</i> Ñurt Connors?


You know him, Peter?


He's one of my teachers, Mr. Robertson


He's an expert in recombining DNA in reptile mutagenics


He's also a genius!


Yeah, yeah, whatever.


You'll be the contact with Connors from now on, kid


But Boss?..


The kid already knows him!


And besides:


do you have any idea what muta-what's-its are?


Aar..


Mr. Jameson, I still think this whole Lizard thing is just a big hoax


Parker!


The first one to get a photo of the Lizard for my nightly news


gets a thousand dollar bonus!


Uh, color or black-and-white?


A thousand dollars!


I can put it down on a new motorcycle, maybe a car!


Wait till I tell aunt May


Hey, pretty lady!


Why the frown?


Nothing, Peter, nothing at all


I just can't decide what to make for dinner, that's all


Why does she always keep things from me?


Look at these bills!


Here I am, thinking of things to buy for myself


She's been like a mother to me for years


It's time I paid her back


And if i can't...


<i>It's a thousand dollar bonus!</i>


...Spider-Man will!


Just once I want an assignment in some nice sunny suburb


Anyway, this Lizard thing is probably just an urban myth


Waite a minute, looks like I was myth-taken


Peter!


Oh, no


Not Debra Whitman


A little sister I never had


or wanted


Since when do you have a night class?


In fact, I always thought of you as having no class at all


*???*


It just so happens I've got something to show Doc Connors


Oh, really?


What?


None of your..Hey!


Hmm, that's interesting


Obviously, reptilian of the Squamata order


But look at the imprint left by the heel


It's an imprint, so.


Yes, but look how deep it is!


A lot of weight on it


Well, maybe it's a very fat Squamata


Or maybe, Peter, it walks on two legs


I knew that!


You didn't...


Shh!


Something's wrong


You're darn right, you were suffocating me!


Nice time for a brownout, eh?


Uhh, no kidding


The storm must be causing it


Who's there?


Who is it?


No! Stay away!


Dr. Connors?


What's wrong?


No, Debra, wait!


It sounds like he needs help


Aaaaah!


Peter!


Debra!


Are you alright?


I've got the wind out of me


What's that thing done to Doc Connors?!


Stop! Come back!


Peter! Don't leave me here alone!


It's alright


Everything's okay now


You were downright brave back there!


It was quite a surprise!


Why, Miss Whitman


is that a compliment?


From you?


Don't push your luck, Peter!


What <i>was</i> that thing?


And why would it kidnap Dr. Connors?


Dr. Connors, I'm ready to proceed


Temperature alpha


Respiration alpha


Life signs all register normal, Dr. Connors


If I'm right, Mickey here is better than normal


Look! Look! There it is!


A reptile's ability to grow a new limb...


...in a mammal!


All because of a couple of micrograms of reptile DNA


and a neogenic recombinator!


Incredible!


No, Peter, this is just the beginning


When we do the same for human beings then we can replace limbs lost in accidents or during a war


<i>That</i> would be incredible


Why would anybody wanna kidnap Dr. Connors?


Mommy? Is daddy coming home?


I don't know, Billy, I...


Aaaaah!


Stay away! Leave us alone!


Easy, Mrs. Connors!


I'm looking for the professor


No! I won't let you hurt my husband!


Hurt him? I...


Noooo!


No! No!


Please!


You're for real!


Just hold that pose, Smiley


Whoa!


Great, there goes my 1000$ dollar photo!


Bah. When am I gonna get the hang of being a super-hero and a photographer at the same time?


Good reflexes!


For a future handbag


Now that you crawled out of your sewer


maybe you'd better stick around


'Cause I wanna know what you did with Doc Connors


Now you're really making me mad!


No, daddy, stop!


Billy!..


"Daddy"?


Did I hear right?


Did he say "daddy"?


Yes. Yes that was Curt.


It all started with that device


Curt called it the "neogenic recombinator"


He used it on himself


as an experiment to make his arm grow again


But it turned him into that... that creature!


Why haven't you told anybody?


The police?


No! They'll think he's a freak!


They'll hunt him down and hurt him


...or worse


I know how that goes


But not If I can reach him first


I'm so scared


We'll keep this quiet


as long as we can


When I break this story it'll be Pulitzer time!


Hang loose, Brock


That webby will melt in a couple of hours


You can't do this!


I already have!


I won't let you ruin Connors' life


What, what!...


Mommy! Mommy!


Billy!


Where's your mom?


Daddy came back and took her away!


Down here!


The sewers...


Listen, I'm gonna carry you to a neighbors' house where you'll be safe


Then I'll go get your mom and your dad too


OK?


OK


But don't let anything happen to them


Let me go!..


Let me go!..


Ugh, what a slimy mess!


Why can't I be one of those galaxy-helping superheroes?


Why do <i>I</i> end up in the sewers?


Ugh


Blurh


Whoa!


You don't find the Fantastic Four in the sewer!


Or the Adventurers


Never had I seen the Adventurers in the sewer!


Or the Defenders!


Well, maybe the Hulk...


Quit whining, Parker


You know what it's really about, don't you:


You're scared


This Lizard creature is powerful enough to tear you limb from limb


But you can't even hurt him


Because trapped inside is your friend


But I have to find him


It's the only way to stop him!


..to save him!


Well isn't this the story of my life?


Put me down, stop!


No! Don't!


Gotta reach him fast


Whoa! Not this fast!


Uh-oh, tilt


*blah-blah-blah*


Uh-oh


My webbing’s losing its consistency


I better change cartridges soon


The worst part of all this is


I was the one who helped Doc with these experiments


If it wasn’t for me... Uh?


Save me! Save me!


The missing subway worker! 


?Felt on > ?
It’s been with some electrical thing


*blah-blah-blah*


I got weak; no food, no sleep.


Aaaaaaaaaaaaa!


Hey(a), come back for me, ri-right?


Yeah, I’m a hero, remember?


*growls*


Why did you bring me here, Kurt? Why?


So we can be together.


You’re still my husband. I love you, I want to be with you, but not like this.


I... love you, too. I need you, and I need your help, with this.


I need your hands to operate it for me. Mine can’t grasp. The other human ?got weak?, scared.


What?.. What are you going to do with that?


Don’t be afraid, Margaret. It’ll transform you. You’ll be able to heal any wound. Replace any limb. First you, then everyone. Once I connect the neogenic recombinator to these electrical conduits, I can reach every home in the city! Every man, woman and child! I can transform all of them! No more suffering, no more pain. 


But Curt. After you transform everyone we’ll all be like you


Of course. I’m the first of the new race! A better race!


If you’re so much better why do you need my hands to help you? You are not better. Look what you’ve become! 


No! You’re twisting things! I can make people ?well? again. And I won’t stop for anything!


Not even for Billy. You want him to be like you too?


My son... I have a son...


Sorry, Doc! I’m doing this for Billy as much as for you!
Oooh!


*growls*


His mind’s all reptile now.


Mrs. Connors! Get away while you can! He’s dangerous! No, don’t touch that thing! Mrs. Connors, run!


Aaah!


Oh, nooo. Margaret, I’m sorry...


?I only get one? chance on this or I’m lizard food. Uh-oh! Jell time!


Curt...


Strange. So strange. A week ago this creature was a scientist. My teacher. My friend. He cared for people and wanted to help them, just as I do. And now look at ?the? both of us. Fighting each other... fighting for our lives! 


Curt! Spider-man!


Curt... Is he?


He’ll be OK.


Ooh, thank heaven!


I’ll help you carry him out of here in a second. But first I have to get something. A thousand-dollar photo! Not too shabby. And what’s it that Brock’s going to end up with? An exclusive story nobody’s ever going to believe!




I tell you, JJ, the Lizard is Curt Connors. I would ??? you earlier but Spider-man webbed me.


Dr. Connors is a respected scientist, Brock. And Peter Parker already brought me photos of the Lizard early this morning.


But I’ll show you the Lizard himself! 


You better be right about this.


Boss, if I’m wrong, I’ll... I’ll, I’ll eat today’s issue of Bugle.


J. Jonah Jameson. What brings you this morning?


You want it cooked or raw?


Peter, where did you get this? 


I sold an exclusive photo to The Daily Bugle.


Oh, dear.


What’s wrong?


Exactly how did you happen to get this picture?


Well.. I...


No *???*


Aunt May, I..


You followed Spider-man into the sewer, didn’t you?


Yeah...right.


It’s cold and damp down there! You probably got germs incubating even as we speak. You need some hot soup and a good long rest. A nice boy like you, taking pictures in the sewer! And what if that horrible Spider-man had caught you?


Aunt May... She’d never understand. Spider-man’s already caught me in his web. And for better or worse he and I are stuck together, forever.


<And that’s the first episode! Wooooooooo! :) >
