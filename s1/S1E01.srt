1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:02,812
New York City

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,886
If only everything down there was really as peaceful

3
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:06,986
as it looks from up here

4
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,469
Yeah, hold it right there

5
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,931
Yeah, like I was saying

6
00:00:26,931 --> 00:00:28,533
you gonna love working down here:

7
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:31,087
it's cool in the summer and warm in the winter

8
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:32,509
and no office politics

9
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,953
Oh, sounds better than my last job

10
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:35,445
I was in the television business

11
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,235
TV? Really?

12
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:39,407
Hey, my old TV gets this double image

13
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:40,241
if you know what I mean

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,430
Hey, maybe you could...

15
00:00:41,429 --> 00:00:42,973
No, I was a TV executive

16
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:44,400
Awww!

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,500
Then you're better off down here

18
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:48,934
Holy!..

19
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,375
Oh, it's got me!

20
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:03,024
Oh! Help!

21
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:05,063
Aaaaaaaaaa!

22
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:10,685
Those eyes! They're after me!

23
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,149
What's this?

24
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:25,556
Another satisfied graduate

25
00:01:25,556 --> 00:01:27,625
of New York City Cab Driving Academy?

26
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,558
Hit the break!

27
00:01:31,145 --> 00:01:32,545
Turn! Turn!

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,791

32
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,260
What was <i>that</i> all about</i>

33
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,312
Eyes, red eyes after me

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,696
Uh-huh. And did they belong to the little pink elephants?

35
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:56,000
No, mister, it was real, it was real, I swear!

36
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,300
Yeah, alright, fine!

37
00:02:57,463 --> 00:02:59,700
Just don't let the cops blame this one on me, okay?

38
00:02:59,777 --> 00:03:01,691
The red eyes! The red eyes!

39
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:03,400
Sure, pal. Whatever you say.

40
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:07,300
New York City. Never a dull moment
